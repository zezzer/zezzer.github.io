				<br></br>
				<h4>I graduate in May of 2018 and am looking for a career in software engineering and working with data.</h4>
				<h4>I would describe myself as a cooperative team player and a fast learner with a good attention to detail.</h4>
				<h4>In addition to programming, I enjoy violin, reading, baking, and derping around.</h4> 
				<h4>I grew up in the Silicon Valley.</h4>
				<h4>I love to think and have long held a fascination with philosophy and psychology.</h4>
				<h4>I persistently strive to challenge myself, be adaptable, and improve. For example, I was extremely shy as a kid so I decided to challenge myself by taking a speech class in high school. It was admittedly uncomfortable at first but I soon discovered that I was enjoying myself. I ended up joining the speech team and winning 1st in a novice tournament for DUO interp.</h4> 
				<h4>This year I wanted to try starting something, so I co-founded the student organization Intermission Orchestra at Berkeley.</h4>
				<h4>Life is a continual journey of growing as a person.</h4>

					<li>
						<h3>IBM Research Intern</h3>
						<h4>I implemented and simulated a new Kubernetes scheduler. Empirical data was acquired by scraping the web and querying SQL databases for the purposes of modeling and visualization. Our proposed algorithm in simulation improved the state-of-the-art by an 18-19% optimality gap. A patent has been submitted for the project and a paper is planned to be submitted to the International Conference on Distributed Conputing Systems (ICDCS).</h4>

						<h3>Testing and Maintenance for Online Data Structures Course</h3>
						<h4>I tested modules and gave feedback on the curriculum for a UC San Diego online course on the Coursera platform. This course was aimed at increasing diversity among learners of computer science. I was entrusted to fix minor issues with the course on a daily basis. I responded to bug reports and discussion forums as a member of the course staff.</h4>

						<h3>Private Java Tutor</h3>
						<h4>I tutored high school students in basic Java and object-oriented principles. I formulated lesson plans and projects that I used for my tutoring sessions.</h4>

						<h3>Web Designer for American Alliance for International Education</h3>
						<h4>I designed a website on the Joomla website using HTML and CSS.</h4>

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<h4>I've been playing violin for over 15 years.</h4>
				<h4>After self teaching the violin for the 4 years preceding, I joined the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra for violin.</h4>
				<h4>I soloed with the UC Chamber orchestra earlier this year, playing Beethoven's Violin Romance in F.</h4>
				<h4>Back when I attended UC San Diego, I was concertmaster of Intermission Orchestra, a student led ensemble that plays video game and film music.</h4>
				<h4>I enjoy playing chamber music.</h4>
				<h4>I love music because I love learning and improving - when faced with a technique issue, I try to focus on getting down to the root cause of the issue (usually something to do with bow awareness and/or posture). Better technique results in a greater range of expression!</h4>
				<h4>When creating music, my ultimate goal is to play expressively and connect with the audience.</h4>
