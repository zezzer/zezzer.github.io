			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<h3>Hi! I'm Zemei, a 3rd year undergrad Computer Science major and Statistics minor at UC Berkeley.</h3>
				<br></br>
				<h4>I'm currently interested in gaining knowledge for and prepping for a career in machine learning and data science.</h4>
				<h4>I would describe myself as a cooperative team player and a fast learner with a good attention to detail.</h4>
				<h4>I'm experimenting with Hadoop and OpenCV right now.</h4>
				<h4>In addition to programming, I enjoy violin, reading, baking, and derping around.</h4> 
				<h4>I grew up in the Silicon Valley.</h4>
				<h4>I love to think and have long held a fascination with philosophy and psychology.</h4>
				<h4>I persistently strive to challenge myself, be adaptable, and improve. For example, I used to be extremely shy as a kid. I decided to challenge myself by taking a speech class in high school. It was admittedly uncomfortable at first but I soon found I was enjoying myself. I ended up joining the speech team and winning 1st in a novice tournament for DUO interp. Life is a continual journey of growing as a person.</h4>

			<h3>I've been playing violin for over 14 years.</h3>
			<br></br>
			<h4>After self teaching the violin for the 4 years preceding, I joined the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra for violin.</h4>
			<h4>Back when I attended UC San Diego, I was concertmaster of Intermission Orchestra, a student led ensemble that plays video game and film music.</h4>
			<h4>I enjoy playing chamber music.</h4>
			<h4>I love music because I love learning and improving - when faced with a technique issue, I try to focus on getting down to the root cause of the issue (usually something to do with bow awareness and/or posture). Better technique results in a greater range of expression!</h4>
			<h4>When creating music, my ultimate goal is to play expressively and connect with the audience.</h4>

			<h3>I enjoy baking and experimenting with recipes.</h3>
			<br></br>
			<h4>Baking is awesome because it feels like an art - if something doesn't turn out so well, I definitely want to learn from my mistakes!</h4>
			<h4>Here are a few pictures I took of my baked goods:</h4>
