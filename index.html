				<h4>I am looking for a career in software and working with data.</h4>
				<h4>I would describe myself as analytical, open-minded, curious, cooperative, and a fast learner.</h4>
				<h4>I persistently strive to challenge myself, be adaptable, and improve. For example, I was extremely shy as a kid so I decided to challenge myself by taking a speech class in high school. It was admittedly uncomfortable but I wanted to keep pushing myself. I ended up joining the speech team and winning 1st place in a novice tournament for DUO interp.</h4> 
				<h4>I play the violin and have been doing so for 15 years. I was a winner of the UC Berkeley Concerto competition last year.</h4> 
				<h4>Last year I wanted to try starting something, so I co-founded the student organization Intermission Orchestra at Berkeley. It went from 2 to 80 members within a couple of months, and we even got a full house of 700 people in the audience by our 2nd concert!</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Intensivate Software Freelancer</h3>
						<h4>For the past summer, I have been freelancing for a start-up. I modified the Draw.io open source code to build a project management graphing application. I deployed the project on an Apache Tomcat web server. I worked on the object model for the application using Javascript ES6.</h4>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>IBM Research Intern</h3>
						<h4>A joint patent has been submitted for this project. I modified Kubernetes open source code to implement a custom Kubernetes scheduler. I ran simulations to compare algorithms. Empirical data was acquired by scraping the web and querying SQL databases for the purposes of modeling and visualization. Our proposed algorithm in simulation improved the state-of-the-art by an 18-19% optimality gap.</h4>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Renewable Energy Labs Research Apprentice</h3>
						<h4>I co-authored a paper on predicted health damages based on the California emissions inventory. I analyzed, wrangled, and visualized energy usage data using Python data science libraries. I scraped the web using Mechanize and Beautiful Soup frameworks in Python.</h4>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Testing and Maintenance for Online Data Structures Course</h3>
						<h4>I tested modules and gave feedback on the curriculum for a UC San Diego online course on the Coursera platform. This course was aimed at increasing diversity among learners of computer science. I was entrusted to fix minor issues with the course on a daily basis. I responded to bug reports and discussion forums as a member of the course staff.</h4>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Private Java Tutor</h3>
						<h4>I tutored high school students in basic Java and object-oriented principles. I formulated lesson plans and projects that I used for my tutoring sessions.</h4>

				<h4>I've been playing violin for over 15 years.</h4>
				<h4>With music, I love being analytical and finding ways to improve - when faced with a technique issue, I try to focus on getting down to the root cause of the issue (usually something to do with bow awareness and/or posture). Better technique results in a greater range of expression!</h4>
				<h4>Check out some of my performances below!</h4>
